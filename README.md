# MPE
Mode parabolic equations, their solutions and test cases

The repository contains MATLAB package for the solution of 3D propagation problems of underwater acoustics by mode parabolic equations (MPE) method. Acoustical field is represented in the form of the modal decomposition, and the respective modal amplitudes are obtained by the solution of MPEs using the SSP (split-step Pade) technique. This package is a supplementary material to a manuscript submitted to the CPC journal.
